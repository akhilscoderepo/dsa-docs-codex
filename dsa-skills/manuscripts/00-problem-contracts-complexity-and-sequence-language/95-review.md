## Review

Use this section after you finish the lessons, and again a few days later. The questions describe situations without naming the habit, so decide before you open the options. They test recognition and prediction, which a guided ladder of exercises does not.

### Test Pattern Recognition

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-budget","q":"A problem allows n up to 200,000 and asks for the count of pairs with a given difference. A teammate proposes checking every pair. What does the constraint signal say?","options":["Fine, because the sample has only six values.","Too slow: about 2 * 10^10 pair checks is far past a budget near 10^8.","Fine, because pairs are checked with simple subtraction.","Too slow only if the values are negative."],"answer":1,"explain":"The count of pairs is n * (n - 1) / 2, which at n = 200,000 is about 2 * 10^10. The sample size is irrelevant, and the cost of each comparison does not change the growth class."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-mutation","q":"A method must return the elements of nums greater than 10, and the statement says the caller keeps using nums afterward. Which design is correct?","options":["Overwrite nums in place and return the new length.","Allocate and return a new array, leaving nums unchanged.","Sort nums first, then overwrite the prefix.","Set the unwanted slots to zero in place."],"answer":1,"explain":"The statement forbids visible changes to the input, so an in-place rewrite breaks the interface even though it would be faster. Allocating the result costs O(n) space and respects the contract."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-sequence","q":"For nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], the candidate [3, 4, 5] is which of the following?","options":["A subarray, a subsequence and a subset.","A subsequence and a subset, but not a subarray.","Only a subset.","None of the three."],"answer":1,"explain":"The positions of 3, 4 and 5 are 0, 2 and 4. They increase, so the order is kept, but they skip positions 1 and 3, so the block is not contiguous."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-guarantee","q":"A statement promises that the array is non-empty. Which first line of a maximum-finding method matches the promise?","options":["if (nums.length == 0) return 0; int best = 0;","int best = nums[0];","int best = Integer.MAX_VALUE;","int best = -1;"],"answer":1,"explain":"The first element is a real member of the input, so it is a safe start. Zero and -1 assume the data is above those values, and the empty guard defines a behavior the statement never asked for."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-cost","q":"Method A scans an array twice in sequence. Method B scans it once but, for each element, scans the elements after it. Which statement is correct?","options":["Both are O(n^2) because each has two loops.","A is O(n) and B is O(n^2).","A is O(n^2) and B is O(n).","Both are O(n) because each loop is a single scan."],"answer":1,"explain":"Sequential loops add, giving 2n for A. Nested loops multiply, giving about n^2 / 2 for B. Counting executions of the inner statement settles it."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-amortized","q":"A growable array doubles its capacity when full. Which claim about append is accurate?","options":["Every append is O(1) in the worst case.","Appends are O(1) amortized, although one append can cost O(n).","Appends are O(n) amortized because of the copying.","Appends are O(log n) amortized."],"answer":1,"explain":"Each doubling copies as many elements as there were appends since the previous doubling, so the total is linear in the number of appends. A single call can still take O(n)."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-dryrun","q":"Your method returns the longest run of equal values. Which single input best attacks its initialization?","options":["A random array of 100,000 values.","A single-element array.","An array sorted in descending order.","An array with a negative first value."],"answer":1,"explain":"With one element the loop body never runs, so the result comes entirely from how the variables were initialized. Random data rarely reaches that case."}
```

```quiz
{"id":"pc-rev-java","q":"Which line inside a loop over n items can silently make the loop quadratic?","options":["total += list.get(i);","list.remove(0);","builder.append(ch);","count++;"],"answer":1,"explain":"Removing at index 0 of an ArrayList shifts every later element, so each call costs O(n). The other lines are constant or amortized constant per call."}
```

### Rebuild The Core Reasoning

Close this page and answer from memory, then check against the lessons. State the contract sheet for a problem of your choice in five lines. Write the loop that counts the steps of a nested loop whose inner index starts one past the outer index, and give its closed form. Explain in two sentences why a doubling array has amortized constant append cost, using either credit or prepaid room. Name three Java calls whose cost or meaning surprises people in a loop, and state the cheaper alternative for each.

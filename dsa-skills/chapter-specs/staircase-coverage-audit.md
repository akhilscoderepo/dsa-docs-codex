# Staircase Coverage Audit

**Audit date:** 2026-10-02  
**Scope:** Active chapter specifications 00-41.  
**Result:** **PASS: 42/42 chapter specifications satisfy the structural staircase contract.**

## What Was Checked

Each row in `Independent Micro-Patterns` must have one named lesson under `Lesson Blueprints`. Every lesson must contain concrete **Build**, **Vary**, **Boundary**, and **Recognize** exercises. Each `Teach now` row must have one non-deferred lesson under `Released Combination Lessons` with the same four roles. A role may not assign a problem that its own text calls deferred.

This is a source-plan audit. It verifies coverage, prerequisite placement, and problem progression before PDF writing. The later PDF pass must still expand each selected exercise into full wording, constraints, examples, hints, reasoning, complexity, and annotated Java.

## Aggregate Result

- Independent micro-patterns planned: **307**
- Authored standalone lesson staircases: **307**
- Teach-now combinations: **57**
- Authored combination staircases: **57**
- Required role steps: **1456**
- Authored role steps: **1456**
- Candidate-bank records: **554**
- Passing chapters: **42/42**

## Findings

- No structural gaps remain in the 42 source specifications.

## Publication Boundary

A passing source specification is ready to drive PDF authoring; it is not itself a finished textbook chapter. Keep the publication gate in every chapter: generate, render, visually inspect, extract text, and correct the PDF before accepting it.

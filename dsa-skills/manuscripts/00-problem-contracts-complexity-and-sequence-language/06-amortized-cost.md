## Amortized Cost

<!-- stage: context -->
### Occasional Resizes Distort One Call

You rent a storage unit for boxes and start with one that holds a single box. When it fills, you rent a unit twice the size and carry every box across. Most days you simply add a box, which takes seconds. Occasionally a day arrives when the unit is full, and the whole afternoon goes to moving.

Ask how long adding a box takes and two honest answers exist. The worst single day takes as long as the whole move, and the typical day takes seconds. A budget that planned every day around the worst afternoon would be absurdly pessimistic, and a budget that ignored the move days would be wrong. Software sees the same pattern whenever a structure repairs or resizes itself now and then, and we need a way to price a whole sequence of operations without lying about either kind of day.

<!-- stage: naive -->
### Charge Every Append Its Worst Cost

The cautious approach to cost is to take the most expensive single operation and multiply by the number of operations. A growing array that copies everything when it fills can be modeled like this.

```java
static long worstCasePerAppend(long appends) {
    long perAppend = appends;          // an append may copy up to every stored element
    return perAppend * appends;
}
```

For one million appends it announces a total of about one trillion steps. That number comes from a real fact, since a single append can indeed copy a lot, and from a wrong multiplication, since not every append can.

<!-- stage: bottleneck -->
### Worst-Case Multiplication Overstates Total Work

The worst-case product is O(n^2), and for `n = 1,000,000` it says 10^12. Counting the copies that a doubling array actually performs for that many appends gives roughly one million, a number that is O(n). The claim is wrong by a factor of about a million, and a team that believed it would reject a perfectly good design.

The mistake is treating the expensive operation as if it happened every time. After a doubling copy of `c` elements, the array has `c` empty slots, so the next `c` appends cost almost nothing before another copy is needed. The expensive events are rare and they pay for themselves by creating room. The opposite danger is just as real. An array that grows by one slot each time really does cost O(n^2) in total, because every append copies everything, and the pessimistic estimate is accurate for that policy and not for doubling.

<!-- stage: insight -->
### Spread Resize Cost Across Appends

The right question is not what the most expensive call costs, but what a long sequence of calls costs in total, divided evenly by the number of calls. That average over a worst-case sequence is the **amortized cost** per operation. It is a guarantee about whole sequences, with no randomness and no assumption about typical inputs.

One way to compute it is to let cheap operations deposit **credit** that the expensive one later spends. Charge every append three units. One unit pays for writing the new value, and the other two are saved. A doubling from capacity `c` to `2c` copies `c` elements, and it can only happen after `c / 2` appends since the previous doubling, because the array held `c / 2` elements right after that doubling. Those `c / 2` appends each saved two units, so `c` units are waiting, which is exactly the price of the copy.

<!-- names: amortized cost, credit, potential -->

Another view is a **potential**, a stored quantity that measures how much prepaid work is sitting in the structure. For the doubling array, the unused slots after a resize are prepaid room. A cheap append lowers that potential by one slot, and the resize converts the used-up potential into a new batch of empty slots. Both views say the same thing: the total charged cost always covers the total actual cost, so the average is constant.

The invariant behind every amortized argument is that, over any sequence of operations, the total amount charged is at least the total actual work done. It does not say any single call is cheap.

<!-- stage: variables -->
### Track Size Capacity And Copies

Track three numbers for the growing array. The size is how many values are stored. The capacity is how many slots are allocated, and a resize happens exactly when the size equals the capacity and one more value arrives. The copy count is the total number of elements moved by resizes so far. The amortized claim compares the copy count after `n` appends with `n` itself, so you will watch that ratio stay bounded under doubling and grow without limit under grow-by-one.

<!-- stage: trace -->
### Trace Eight Doubling Appends

Start with capacity 1. The first append finds one free slot and writes, so no copy happens. The second append finds the array full, grows the capacity to 2, copies the single stored element and then writes. The third append finds capacity 2 full, grows to 4 and copies two elements. The fourth append fits without any work.

The fifth append triggers the largest repair so far. Capacity 4 is full, so the array grows to 8 and copies four elements. Appends six, seven and eight then fit for free. The capacities seen are 1, 2, 4 and 8, and the copies total 1 + 2 + 4, which is 7 for eight appends. That is fewer than one copy per append, and the hardest step is the fifth, where the single append that copies four elements still sits inside a total that stays linear. Every doubling is followed by as many cheap appends as there were copies, which is the mechanism behind the bound.

```trace
{"cells":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],"pointers":["size","cap"],"steps":[{"at":{"size":1,"cap":1},"vars":{"capacity":1,"copiedNow":0,"totalCopies":0},"note":"Append 1: a free slot exists, so it just writes. No copy. Total copies 0."},{"at":{"size":2,"cap":2},"vars":{"capacity":2,"copiedNow":1,"totalCopies":1},"note":"Append 2: the array was full, so it grows to capacity 2 and copies 1 element, then writes.

```

<!-- stage: code -->
### Measure A Growth Policy

```java
static long copiesForAppends(int appends, boolean doubling) {
    int capacity = 1, size = 0;
    long copies = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < appends; k++) {
        if (size == capacity) {
            capacity = doubling ? capacity * 2 : capacity + 1;
            copies += size;                    // every stored element is moved to the new array
        }
        size++;
    }
    return copies;
}
```

The loop mirrors what a growable array does when a value arrives. The condition `size == capacity` is the only place a resize happens, and the cost of that resize is the number of elements already stored. Switching the policy flag changes the capacity update and leaves the accounting identical, which is the point of the exercise. Both runs take O(appends) time to simulate, and the counts they return differ enormously, linear for doubling and quadratic for growing by one.

<!-- stage: applicability -->
### Amortized Bounds Cover Operation Sequences

Reach for amortized reasoning when an operation is usually cheap but sometimes does a large repair, and the repair creates room for many cheap calls afterward. Typical cases are growable arrays, hash table resizing, and a queue built from two stacks, which a later chapter uses. The invariant is that the total charged cost over any sequence of operations pays for the total actual cost.

The false friend is the word amortized itself. Amortized O(1) is not worst-case O(1) for every call, and one unlucky call can still take O(n). That matters when a single slow call is unacceptable, as in a latency-sensitive loop, and it does not matter when only the total over many calls counts. Amortized analysis is also not an average over random inputs. It is a worst-case statement about a sequence.

Java's `ArrayList` documents that `add` runs in amortized constant time, and interview answers should say amortized and not constant. The policy matters, because growth by a fixed number of slots would lose the guarantee, while growth by any constant factor above one keeps it.

### Exercises

#### Doubling Array
<!-- id: pc-doubling-array -->
<!-- role: Build -->
<!-- source: Author exercise -->

##### Problem Statement

Start with capacity 1 and append eight values, doubling the capacity whenever the array is full. List the capacities that occur, count every element copy, and observe that the total stays proportional to the number of appends.

##### Constraints

Capacity starts at 1 and doubles on demand. A copy moves each stored element once and the new value's write is not counted as a copy.

##### Examples

**Example 1.** Input 8 appends, output capacities 1, 2, 4, 8 and a total of 7 copies.

**Example 2.** Input 1 append, output capacity 1 and 0 copies, since the first value fits without any resize.

##### Prerequisites

The size, capacity and copy-count bookkeeping in this lesson.

##### Hint

Which appends find the array full? How many elements are stored at the moment of each resize?

##### Learning Objective

First rung: turns the idea of occasional repair into a concrete tally of copies.

#### Grow By One
<!-- id: pc-grow-by-one -->
<!-- role: Vary -->
<!-- source: Author exercise -->

##### Problem Statement

Repeat the experiment when the capacity increases by exactly one each time the array is full. Sum `1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)` and explain why append becomes O(n) amortized instead of O(1).

##### Constraints

Capacity starts at 1 and grows by 1 on demand. Copies follow the same counting rule as the doubling exercise.

##### Examples

**Example 1.** Input 8 appends, output 28 copies, compared with 7 for doubling.

**Example 2.** Input 1 append, output 0 copies, so the two policies agree on the smallest sequence.

##### Prerequisites

The doubling-array exercise above.

##### Hint

With growth by one, how often is the array full, and how many elements are stored each time? What does the sum of the first `n - 1` integers equal?

##### Learning Objective

Only the growth rule changes, and it converts a linear total into a quadratic one.

#### One Expensive Append
<!-- id: pc-one-expensive-append -->
<!-- role: Boundary -->
<!-- source: Author exercise -->

##### Problem Statement

In a doubling array that reaches 1,025 stored values, identify the single append that triggers an O(n) copy. Reconcile that spike with the claim that appends are amortized O(1) over the whole sequence.

##### Constraints

Capacity starts at 1 and doubles on demand. Count 1,025 appends in total, so the final append is the one to examine.

##### Examples

**Example 1.** Input 1,025 appends, output that append number 1,025 copies 1,024 elements while the 1,024 appends before it copied 1,023 elements in total.

**Example 2.** Input 1,024 appends, output no spike at the end, since capacity 1,024 is exactly full and no further append has arrived.

##### Prerequisites

The two exercises above.

##### Hint

When is the array full after exactly a power of two values? How many copies came from all the earlier resizes combined?

##### Learning Objective

The question moves from the total to a single spike, and the exercise asks you to explain why one costly call does not break the average.

#### Potential Intuition
<!-- id: pc-potential-intuition -->
<!-- role: Recognize -->
<!-- source: Author exercise -->

##### Problem Statement

Treat the unused slots after a doubling as prepaid capacity. Explain, without formal algebra, how that stored potential funds the future cheap appends and the next resize, and show with numbers why a charge of three units per append is enough.

##### Constraints

Charge three units per append: one to write and two saved. A resize from capacity `c` to `2c` costs `c` units.

##### Examples

**Example 1.** Input a resize from capacity 4 to 8 after four stored values, output that the two appends since the previous resize saved 4 units and the copy costs 4.

**Example 2.** Input the very first resize from capacity 1 to 2 after one stored value, output that the one earlier append saved 2 units and the copy costs 1, so a unit is even left over.

##### Prerequisites

All three exercises above.

##### Hint

After a resize to capacity `2c`, how many appends can happen before the next resize? How many units does each of those appends save?

##### Learning Objective

The argument shifts from counting copies to explaining why the counted total is bounded, using stored credit.
